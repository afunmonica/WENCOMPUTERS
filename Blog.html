          There are various kind of devices with are afforable and o quality that you can get at Wen Computers. 
          moreover are things are less expensive.
          you're totally responsible. The gallery below provides you with the list of different computers.
          Once you have all essential things for your blog, it is time to register it online. Choose your domain name and register it at godaddy.com, and continue to WordPress where you can start your own page very easily.

Once you started, you have to be ready to write it for yourself for the first few months. As the readers will not come straight away clearly. So I would recommend you to connect all your social media platforms and try to redirect audience to your website. It takes time, but eventually people will get to know it, and if they like it – they will come back 
The thing I would like to highlight again is a good computer, make sure to have a light one, that you can carry around with you. As blogging is a full time job, involving a lot of traveling and different locations. you never know where you will end up, so make sure that your computer is easy to use, powerful and light. Like Dell. They are known since 1986 and they specially empower countries, communities, customers and people everywhere to use technology to realize their dreams. They deliver technology solutions that help to do and achieve more, whether you are at home, work, school or anywhere in their world. I would highly recommend one of the XPS laptops.

          During the whole day we had very interesting sessions, mixed with some snacks, drinks and good company.

While attending the event I got a chance to think a bit more about blogging in general, and as many of you have been asking me how do you start a blog, how do you get readers and create audience – i decided to dedicate a blog post to it.

First thing you need to have is of course a good computer and a cell phone. Computer is essential for the online blog – your website, so it is probably the most important thing, and it is worth to invest some money into a proper device. I would recommend Dell, as they are extremely powerful and easy to use, have many different tools for creating blog posts and are extremely fast at the same time. We were using Dell XPS-15 computers, which is the worlds smallest 15.6” laptop pack with amazing Infinity Edge display. Not to mention how incredible powerful and fast it is. If this one doesn’t seem to be the right, you have many more styles available, like Dell XPS 13, or XPS 13 ultrabook which is extremely practical as well. They offer a huge variety of different computers so you can surely find one for yourself!<h3 class="fieldset-legend">click to read more ..........................</h3>
